### 1. **Header and Footer**
- **Header**: Include the title "Analytical Dashboard" with a subtitle describing the data. Add a global search box and filter options.
- **Footer**: Include "Created by Jaymin Rabari" with your LinkedIn profile and the year. You can use a simple Bootstrap footer component.

### 2. **Search Box & Filters (Year Filter Logic)**
   - **Search Box**: Create a global search bar at the top of the dashboard to filter results. When a user types, it should filter all charts and tables.
   - **Year Filter**: 
      - **Start Year Filter**: Users can search by start year, and all the charts will update accordingly.
      - **End Year Logic**: For insights with missing end years, show data for ongoing trends or insights. If an end year exists, limit the data displayed. To handle this:
        - If a user selects an **end year**, show insights whose **start year** is ≤ end year and either **no end year** or **end year** ≥ the selected year.

### 3. **Row of Summary Cards**
   - Use **Bootstrap cards** to display total counts of key metrics at the top:
     - **Total Countries** (with data)
     - **Total Regions**
     - **Total Sources**
     - **Total Topics**
     - **Total Sectors**
     - **Total PESTLE Factors**
     - **Total Insights**

### 4. **Main Charts**
   Now, let's choose the right type of charts for each data visualization.

#### a. **Country and Region Chart (Map-Based)**
   - **Recommended Chart**: **Choropleth Map** (geo chart)
     - A **choropleth map** is perfect for displaying data based on regions or countries. Use **Leaflet.js** or **Google Maps API** to render an interactive map where countries/regions are shaded based on the number of insights.
     - Each country or region can display a tooltip with additional data (e.g., count of insights, intensity).

#### b. **Sector-Based Chart**
   - **Recommended Chart**: **Donut or Pie Chart**
     - A **donut chart** works well for showing distribution across sectors.
     - Use a **chart.js** or **d3.js donut chart** where each sector slice shows its relative size.

#### c. **Topic-Based Chart**
   - **Recommended Chart**: **Bar Chart**
     - Use a **horizontal bar chart** to display various topics and their frequency. It’s easy for users to compare different topics this way.
     - **Chart.js** or **ApexCharts** would be ideal for this.

#### d. **Source-Based Chart**
   - **Recommended Chart**: **Stacked Column Chart**
     - A **stacked column chart** can visualize how sources contribute to various insights.
     - This allows users to see the contribution of each source over time or topic.

#### e. **PESTLE-Based Chart**
   - **Recommended Chart**: **Radar Chart**
     - A **radar chart** can visualize data across the PESTLE framework. The radar chart provides an easy way to compare the various PESTLE categories.
     - **Chart.js radar chart** or **ApexCharts** can be used.

#### f. **Main Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance Chart**
   - **Recommended Chart**: **Bubble Chart**
     - A **bubble chart** is ideal for visualizing three variables at once (intensity, likelihood, and relevance). The size of the bubble could represent **intensity**, while the x and y axes can represent **likelihood** and **relevance**.
     - **D3.js** or **Chart.js bubble charts** are a great choice.

### 5. **Insight Table**
   - **Table Layout**: Use a **Bootstrap table** or **react-table** to display a list of insights.
     - Columns: Title, Source, Published Year, Added Date, URL.
     - Make this table sortable and searchable.

### 6. **Filter Functionality Across All Charts**
   - **Unified Filtering**: When a user applies a filter (search box, start year, topic, etc.), all the charts should update dynamically. This can be implemented using **React’s state management** to trigger re-rendering of the components.
   - **Debouncing the Search**: For the search functionality, use **debouncing** to avoid performance issues while users type.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Use Interactivity**:
   - Make charts interactive. Hover effects should display tooltips with more detailed info (e.g., exact intensity, likelihood for a country/region).
   - Allow drill-down in charts. For example, clicking on a sector could update the table or show related insights.

2. **Color Scheme and UI**:
   - Use a clean, minimalistic color scheme. For choropleth maps, use gradients to represent intensity visually.
   - For the entire dashboard, **light/dark mode** could enhance the user experience.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Since you have thousands of data points, ensure charts and the dashboard are **optimized for performance**. Use lazy loading where necessary.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the dashboard is **fully responsive**. On smaller screens, the charts should stack vertically and still be user-friendly.

### Summary of Dashboard Components:
1. **Header**: Search bar + Filters.
2. **Cards**: Displaying counts of key metrics.
3. **Charts**: 
   - **Map (Choropleth)** for country/region insights.
   - **Donut Chart** for sectors.
   - **Bar Chart** for topics.
   - **Stacked Column Chart** for sources.
   - **Radar Chart** for PESTLE categories.
   - **Bubble Chart** for Intensity, Likelihood, Relevance.
4. **Insight Table**: With Title, Source, Published Year, URL.
5. **Footer**: Contact info and credits.
